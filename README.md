# Projects
## Current Project:
I am currently working on the backend of a Fantasy Football web app (currently private but will be make public soon).
The end goal for this back end is for it to be a RESTful API that can give updated stats along with some statistical analysis to try and find the best players available for any given week.  I chose to code this project using Python and Flask.
### Milestones:
- [ ] Game data scraping 
- [ ] Weekly scraping of all NFL game data

- [ ] Simple get requests on various routes (player, team, season, week, etc.)
- [ ] Begin in depth analysis (methods TBD)

## Future Projects:
- [ ] Frontend of Fantasy Football web app (Using Node and React)
- [ ] Dockerize front and backend
